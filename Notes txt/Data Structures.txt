Data Structures Overview

we use data structures to store data in an efficient way

we often have the intuition: if we want to make an algorithm fast, we have to ooptimize it.
(fewer operations, avoid nested for loops etc.)

make every calculation as fast as possible

BUT algorithms can be boosted up by proper data structures.
